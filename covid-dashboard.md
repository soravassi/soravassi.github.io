# Covid Dashboard

[<Back](./)

In February 2020 I had a trip to Italy when the number of Covid-19 cases started blowing up there. I couldn't find a dashboard that compared the growth of cases between countries, to help estimate how many cases there would be by the time of the trip. The original idea was to compare the growth in Italy to China and South Korea, the main hotspots at the time. So, using The Johns Hopkins University's database available on github, I decided to work on a dashboard in which this visualization was possible. __This dashboard refreshes daily.__
