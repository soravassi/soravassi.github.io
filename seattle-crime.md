# Seattle Crime Trends

<a href="./" class="previous round">&#8249;</a>

As a consequence of Covid-19, I had started to hear in day-to-day conversations that violent crime rates were going up in major cities, including Seattle.
That got me thinking about Hans Gosling's book [Factfulness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness) in which he outlines that the world is better today than in the past in many aspects, including violent crime, contrary to popular belief. This inspired me to leverage data from [http://data.seattle.gov](http://data.seattle.gov) and break down crime trends in Seattle and see if there was indeed a reason to worry. __This dashboard refreshes daily.__
